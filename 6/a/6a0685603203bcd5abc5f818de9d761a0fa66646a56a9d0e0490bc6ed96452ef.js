We would encourage them to look for stories closer to home or discuss whether it&rsquo;s possible to do the story justice with reporting by phone and video calls. Cutting out flights is a major way we&rsquo;ve reduced the carbon footprint of Future Planet &ndash; a single flight from London to, say, Cape Town, for example, emits 1.6 tonnes of carbon &ndash; the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.epa.gov\u002Fenergy\u002Fgreenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator\"\u003Eequivalent of running an average home&rsquo;s electricity for nearly 100 days\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOur focus on working with local reporters around the world also keeps long-distance travel to a minimum. If a longer-distance story is commissioned, we might ask the reporter to look around for other strong stories in the area, to make the most of our transport emissions. And once a story has been commissioned, our reporters keep note of what travel they do to report the story, including how far they go and the method of transport they use, and use an independently audited carbon calculator for travel to estimate emissions. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDigital footprint\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis part of the calculation involves estimating the energy used to transfer data over the internet and the carbon intensity of electricity (the amount of CO2 emitted per unit of electricity consumed). We worked with the agency Wholegrain Digital to get a bespoke carbon estimate for Future Planet stories. (The BBC does not endorse particular products or services; rather, it was the only agency we could find offering a service to calculate carbon for a website&rsquo;s emissions.)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor a digital story, one of the big things we need to think about is the number of people who read it. As we can&rsquo;t predict exactly how many readers will click on the story before we publish it, we use a per-pageview emissions estimate, which is the same for all stories. We got this figure using a test story, calculating emissions as above and then dividing that by the pageviews that the test story actually had over six months. That gives us a better estimate than just plugging in the URL from a story to the agency&rsquo;s standard carbon calculator, because for a story where the number of pageviews is a weighty factor in the equation, using data on actual pageviews makes it more accurate.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe story we used as a test to get this figure was a BBC Future story, and we used the actual number of pageviews it had over a six-month period. Factors such as how many images a page has and the length of the story can make a big difference in the energy required to load the page, and how long the reader spends on the page. Our stories vary in length and number of images, so it&rsquo;s important to stress that this figure is an estimate, not a precise measurement.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20200131-why-and-how-does-future-planet-count-carbon-2"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"Image","iFrameType":"","image":[],"imageAlignment":"centre","imageOrientation":"landscape","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20200131-why-and-how-does-future-planet-count-carbon-3"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003EHere are some other inherent unknowns we had to contend with:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThe device that a reader accesses the story on can make a big difference to the energy used.

The BBC also uses Content Delivery Networks, third-party networks of servers that reduce the load on our own. The calculation doesn&rsquo;t take account of this, which slightly inflates the estimate as CDNs are more efficient.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe cumulative uncertainty from these factors is the reason we show the digital component of emissions as a range, rather than a single figure.

What about the BBC staff who work on Future Planet, some full-time but many sporadically among other obligations &ndash; do we count, for example, the energy used to heat and power the office? If we do, should we count the carbon emissions from the large number of energy-hungry servers housed in the building, or is that irrelevant as they don&rsquo;t host Future Planet? Or you could take it even further: if a journalist ate a sandwich while on location reporting for us, do we count the carbon footprint of the food &ndash; or not, since they&rsquo;d likely have to eat regardless of whether they were on assignment?
