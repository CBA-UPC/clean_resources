<p>We store the information we collect for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it. We may retain certain information for legitimate business purposes or as required by law.</p>
<p><br>DATA TRANSFERS AND PRIVACY SHIELD</p>
<p>RevContent is based in the U.S.<em> </em> As such, we and our service providers may transfer your information to, or store or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide equivalent levels of data protection as your home jurisdiction. We will take steps to ensure that your personal data receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it.</p>
<p>When we transfer personal data from the European Union or Switzerland to the United States, we comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss - U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. RevContent has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.</p>
<p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we are committed to resolving complaints about our processing of your personal data. EU and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with the Privacy Shield program should first contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@revcontent.com">privacy@revcontent.com</a> We have further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact or visit <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield">https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield</a> claim for more information or to file a complaint. The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you. Under certain conditions, you may be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint. RevContent is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.</p>
<p>If we share personal data transferred to the U.S. under the Privacy Shield with a third-party service provider that processes such data on our behalf, then we will be liable for that third party’s processing in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we can prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>
<p>HOW WE PROTECT THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</p>
<p>We take reasonable measures to help protect the information we collect from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.&nbsp; However, no transmission over the internet or electronic storage can be completely secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any data.</p>
<p>RESIDENTS OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA</p>
<p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you have certain rights and protections under the law regarding the processing of your personal data.</p>
<p><em>Legal Basis for Processing</em></p>
<p>If you are a resident of the EEA, when we process your personal data we will only do so in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to use your personal data to perform our responsibilities under our contract with you (e.g., processing payments for and providing the services you have requested).</li>
<li>We have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data. For example, we may process your personal data to provide content and advertisements that may be of interest to you, to communicate with you about changes to our Services, and to provide, secure, and improve our Services.</li>
<li>There is another applicable lawful basis under which we are permitted to process your personal data.</li>

<p>RESIDENTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA</p>
<p>For Residents of the State of California, the following provisions address the foundational principles of the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> </strong><strong>DATA PROTECTION PRINCIPLES</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The COMPANY is committed to processing data in accordance with its responsibilities under the CCPA, and in particular with regard to the principles articulated therein which affirm a right to privacy, provide California consumers should be able to exercise control over their personal information, and provide that there are safeguards against misuse of their personal information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those principles require that where this organization collects personal information about a consumer who is a California resident (“Consumer” or hereinafter “consumer”) the Consumer has a right to request disclosure of:</p>
<p>a. the categories and specific pieces of personal information we collect;</p>
<p>b. the categories of sources from which that information is collected;</p>
<p>c. the business purposes for collecting or selling the information;</p>
<p>d. the categories of third-parties with which the information is shared;</p>
<p>e. disclosures about the information, and</p>
<p>f. the purposes for which the information is used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those principles also require upon verified request:<br>g. the deletion of personal information;</p>
<p>h. disclosure of the categories of information collected that we sell or disclose; and</p>
<p>i. the disclosure of the identity of third-parties to whom the information was sold or disclosed;<br><br><br><br>And, among other rights,<br>j. authorize the Consumer to opt out of the sale of personal information; and</p>
<p>k. prohibit discrimination against the Consumer for exercising privacy rights.</p>
<p>While we operate primarily if not exclusively as a Service Provider under the CCPA, we are committed to supporting those rights and do so with the following policy provisions, as applicable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. GENERAL PROVISIONS</strong></p>
<p>a. This policy applies to all California resident consumer personal information (“Consumer Data”) processed or controlled by the COMPANY.</p>
<p>b. Personal information (“Consumer Data”) means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. It includes identifiers such as a real name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, Internet protocol address, email address, account name, social security number, driver’s license number, passport number or anything similar. “Personal information” does not include publicly available information. “Personal information” does not include consumer information that is deidentified or aggregate consumer information.</p>
<p>c. This policy shall be reviewed at least annually.</p>
<p>d. The COMPANY shall comply with an order of the California Attorney General.</p>
<p>e. The COMPANY shall seek to cure violations of the CCPA within 30 days of written notice of alleged noncompliance by a consumer.</p>
<p>f. To ensure its processing of data is lawful, fair and transparent, the COMPANY shall maintain a Register of Systems which shall include a list of systems containing personal information of California consumers, service providers and third-parties (as that term is defined in the CCPA Regulations) with which it does business.</p>
<p>g. The Register of Systems shall be reviewed at least annually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. LAWFUL, FAIR AND TRANSPARENT PROCESSING </strong><br>a. Where the COMPANY collects personal information about a Consumer, upon receipt of a verifiable Consumer request, the COMPANY shall disclose to that consumer the categories and specific pieces of personal information the business has collected and shall disclose and deliver promptly and free of charge. See 5(a) and (b) below for the information to be provided.</p>
<p>b. Where such information is disclosed and delivered, it shall, be delivered by mail or electronically, and, if delivered electronically, it shall be provided in a portable form and, to the extent technically feasible, delivered in a readily useable format that allows the consumer to transmit this information to another entity without hindrance.</p>
<p>c. Where the COMPANY collects a Consumer’s personal information, it shall, at or before the point of collection, inform consumers as to the categories of personal information to be collected and the purposes for which the categories of personal information shall be used. The COMPANY shall not collect additional categories of personal information or use personal information collected for additional purposes without providing the Consumer with notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. RIGHT TO BE FORGOTTEN </strong><br>a. Where the COMPANY collects personal information about a Consumer, it shall, upon verified request, delete any personal information about the Consumer which the COMPANY has collected from the Consumer from its records and direct any service providers to delete the Consumer’s personal information from their records.</p>
<p>b. Where the COMPANY collects personal information about a Consumer, it shall disclose to the Consumer the Consumer’s rights to request the deletion of the Consumer’s personal information.</p>
<p>c. This right to be forgotten shall not prevent the COMPANY from using the Consumer’s personal information to:</p>
<p>I. complete the transaction for which it was collected,</p>
<p>II. detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; or prosecute those responsible for that activity,</p>
<p>III. debug to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality,</p>
<p>IV. comply with the California Penal Code,</p>
<p>V. engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest,</p>
<p>VI. enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the consumer based on the consumer’s relationship with the business, or</p>
<p>VII. comply with a legal obligation or otherwise use the information in a lawful manner compatible with the context in which the information was given.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6. RIGHT TO OPT-OUT</strong></p>
<p>a. The COMPANY may not sell Consumer personal information unless the Consumer has been given the right, at any time, to opt-out.</p>
<p>b. The COMPANY shall not sell Consumer Data that has been sold to it by another business unless the Consumer has received explicit notice and given the opportunity not to sell that consumer’s personal information (known as the right to opt-out).</p>
<p>c. The COMPANY may not sell Consumer personal information unless the Consumer has been provided notice that this information may be sold and that consumers have the right to opt out of the sale of their personal information.</p>
<p>d. Such notice shall be in a form that is reasonably accessible to consumers and: (1) provide a clear and conspicuous link on the COMPANY’s Internet homepage, titled “Do Not Sell My Personal Information,” to an Internet Web page that enables a consumer, or a person authorized by the consumer, to opt out of the sale of the consumer’s personal information, and (2) include a description of a consumer’s rights , along with a separate link to the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” Internet Web page in: (A) online privacy policy or policies if any, (B) any California-specific description of consumers’ privacy rights.</p>
<p>e. The COMPANY, if it sells consumer’s personal information, shall:<br>(1) ensure that all individuals responsible for handling consumer inquiries about the business’s privacy practices or the business’s compliance are informed of all requirements and how to direct consumers to exercise their rights,<br>(2) for consumers who exercise their right to opt out of the sale of their personal information, refrain from selling personal information collected by the business about the consumer,<br>(3) for a consumer who has opted out of the sale of the consumer’s personal information, respect the consumer’s decision to opt out for at least 12 months before requesting that the consumer authorize the sale of the consumer’s personal information, and<br>(4) use any personal information collected from the consumer’s opt-out request solely for the purposes of complying with the opt-out request.</p>
<p>f. The COMPANY shall allow a consumer to authorize another person solely to opt-out of the sale of the consumer’s personal information on the consumer’s behalf.</p>

The COMPANY shall, once it has received direction from a consumer not to sell the consumer’s personal information or, in the case of a minor consumer’s personal information has not received consent to sell the minor consumer’s personal information, stop selling the consumer’s personal information, unless the consumer subsequently provides express authorization for the sale of the consumer’s personal information.</p>
<p>h. The COMPANY shall not sell personal information of consumers where it has actual knowledge that the consumer is less than 16 years of age, unless the consumer, in the case of consumers between 13 and 16 years of age, or the consumer’s parent or guardian, in the case of consumers who are less than 13 years of age, has affirmatively authorized the sale of the consumer’s personal information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7. NO DISCRIMINATION</strong></p>
<p>a. The COMPANY shall not discriminate against a Consumer for exercising its rights under California privacy law (such as denying services or charging a different price greater than the value of consumer's data).</p>
<p>b.

<p>a. The COMPANY shall, for the purpose of receiving requests for information under the California Consumer Privacy law, make available for consumers at a minimum, two designated methods for submitting requests, including a toll-free telephone number, and if the COMPANY maintains an Internet Web site, a Web site address. Where the COMPANY operates exclusively online, it may, instead, provide an email address only.</p>
<p>b. Where such a request is received, the COMPANY shall disclose and deliver the required information to a consumer free of charge within 45 days of receiving a verifiable request from the consumer (extended only once by an additional 45 days when reasonably necessary, provided the consumer is provided notice of the extension within the first 45-day period).</p>
<p>c. The information is to be delivered through the Consumer’s account with us, if the consumer maintains an account with us, or by mail or electronically at the Consumer’s option if the Consumer does not maintain an account, in a readily useable format that allows the Consumer to transmit this information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
<p>d. The COMPANY’s online privacy policy or policies or any California-specific description of consumers' privacy rights, (or by mail if the COMPANY does not maintain such policies on its Internet Web site) shall provide a description of a consumer's rights under California privacy law and one or more designated methods for submitting requests (and shall be updated at least every 12 months).</p>
<p>e. All individuals responsible for handling Consumer inquiries about the COMPANY’s privacy practices or compliance with California privacy laws are to be informed of all requirements concerning Consumers rights to request information concerning personal information collected, sold or disclosed, Consumers' right not to be discriminated against and how to direct Consumers to exercise their rights.</p>
<p>f. Any personal information collected from a Customer in connection with the COMPANY’s verification of a Customer’s request is to be used solely for the purposes of verification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>c.

The notification may be delayed if a law enforcement agency determines that the notification will impede a criminal investigation, but shall be made promptly after the law enforcement agency determines that it will not compromise the investigation.</p>
d. Security breach notification shall be written in plain language titled “Notice of Data Breach,” containing information under the following headings: “What Happened,” “What Information Was Involved,” “What We Are Doing,” “What You Can Do,” and “For More Information.” The format is to be designed to call attention to the nature and significance of the information it contains, with titles and headings in the notice clearly and conspicuously displayed.
