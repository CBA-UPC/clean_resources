bc_json652({"recommendationBlock":[],"trackingPixel":""})is about uh training our bodies to be

00:00:05.488 --> 00:00:08.509
OK, feeling a little bit of, of that

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.579
physiologic arousal at times where we are in control.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.679
So for example, the Navy Seals will do a

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.839
lot of stress inoculation where they'll practice going into uh

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.940
war zones that are, that are all uh of

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:25.519
their own making where they're, you know, these

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.719
training scenarios where they can practice inoculating themselves with what

00:00:30.728 --> 00:00:33.639
it feels like to have their adrenaline rush and what

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:35.750
it feels like to have their, you know,

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:37.539
their thoughts start to ask, oh, what if

00:00:37.548 --> 00:00:38.899
, what if, what if, what if so

00:00:38.908 --> 00:00:41.700
they can learn to be with those moments and learn

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:44.270
to work with those so that they know when the

00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:47.399
real thing comes, they will, they will have

00:00:47.408 --> 00:00:49.880
the skills to be able to work with them.

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:53.289
So the the real connection between stress inoculation and physical

00:00:53.298 --> 00:00:56.179
challenge is that when we get stressed, when we

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:59.709
have this physiologic arousal, we start to feel our

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.598
heart racing, we start to breathe fast naturally.

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:04.879
You know, we have all of these physiologic changes

00:01:04.888 --> 00:01:07.870
that happen that basically put us into this fight or

00:01:07.879 --> 00:01:11.510
flight mode And so the the physicality of that is

00:01:11.519 --> 00:01:15.948
really a manifestation of, of this stress saying,

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:17.689
hey, you know, there could be danger out

00:01:17.698 --> 00:01:19.650
there, you need to be ready to run or

00:01:19.659 --> 
fight.
