Though the term seems to have entered the public lexicon in early 2020 around the start of Covid-19-related lockdowns, the public has long held the can&rsquo;t-look-away-from-a-car-crash mentality Bernstein mentions when it comes to consuming news.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;The precursor to going online was that people would watch the 11 o&rsquo;clock news, [which] was terrifying,&rdquo; says Dean McKay, a Fordham University psychology professor who specialises in compulsive behaviour and anxiety disorders. That terror, when witnessed from the comfort of the viewer&rsquo;s home, however, had a potentially calming effect.

All human emotional states emerged because they were somehow adaptive. So, wanting to vicariously feel a certain emotion from reading news or comments, like anger or despair, may be a way for us to &ldquo;practice evolved coping mechanisms&rdquo; we&rsquo;ve developed for managing negative life events. Being scared, for example, puts us on high alert, which is useful in dangerous situations.

During much of lockdown she had to move her shop from bricks-and-mortar to online, but sales haven&rsquo;t suffered hugely. Crucially, she says, she and her husband have been equally dividing domestic tasks and care of their four-year-old son.

It helped that she could compensate for her husband&rsquo;s strict schedule by making her own hours, but that can&rsquo;t continue once the shop is running normally.
