If you cancel your subscription or a payment fails, you won't have access to your badge anymore, but your time as a Supporter will be stored for posterity: Should you resume your subscription, it will continue from the level you were on when you canceled (i.e., if you canceled at Copper after four months, you would resume at Copper upon reactivating your subscription).
