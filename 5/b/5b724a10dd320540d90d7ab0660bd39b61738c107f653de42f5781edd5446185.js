/**
 * @file
 * Provides Ajax page updating via jQuery $.ajax.
 *
 * Ajax is a method of making a request via JavaScript while viewing an HTML
 * page. The request returns an array of commands encoded in JSON, which is
 * then executed to make any changes that are necessary to the page.
 *
 * Drupal uses this file to enhance form elements with `#ajax['url']` and
 * `#ajax['wrapper']` properties. If set, this file will automatically be
 * included to provide Ajax capabilities.
