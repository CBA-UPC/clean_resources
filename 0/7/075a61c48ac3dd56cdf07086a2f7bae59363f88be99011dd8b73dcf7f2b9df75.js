  <meta name="description" content="Sporting News is the oldest sporting publication in the United States. A weekly from its debut in 1886 until 2008, it was for decades known informally as “The Bible of Baseball” and was essential reading for players, officials, and fans. Beginning in the 1940s, it began to cover a wider array of sports and, in the more recent past, has given prominence to professional football. As sports media have proliferated in print, on the airwaves, and online, the Sporting News has undergone several transformations as it has struggled to maintain a unique presence in a very competitive environment and to attract sufficient numbers of readers and advertisers.">

  <p>
    Sporting Media USA Inc. ("<strong>we</strong>", <strong>us</strong>" or "<strong>Sporting Media</strong>") is a wholly owned business division of the Sporting News Holdings Limited Company No. 018380V (‘Sporting News Group’). Sporting News Group is a group of companies which own, operate (either for ourselves or on behalf of third-parties) or represent a number of free-to-use digital sports media properties, which are either websites or mobile applications. In this notice, each of the properties is referred to as a "<strong>platform</strong>".  When we refer to the "<strong>Service</strong>" in this Privacy Notice, this means the provision of the content on the platforms to the user.
    </br></br>
    This Privacy Notice explains why we collect information concerning the users of the platforms (each a "<strong>user</strong>", "<strong>you</strong>" or "<strong>your</strong>"), what type of information we collect and how we use that information.  This Privacy Notice applies to any such information collected via any platform which displays it (or a link to it).
    </br></br>
    Any references within this Privacy Policy to the Sporting News Group includes Sporting News Holdings Limited and its affiliates, including, but not limited to, the following entities:
    <ul>
      <li>Sporting Media USA Inc.</li>
      <li>Sporting News Enterprises UK Limited</li>
      <li>Sporting News (Australia) Pty. Ltd.</li>
      <li>SportingNews Japan GK</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
  </p>
  <p>
    Additional information for users located in the European Economic Area ("<strong>EEA</strong>"), Switzerland and the UK about their rights and other information can be found in the ANNEX to this Privacy Notice.
  </p>
<li class="main-list">What data we collect</li>
  <p>
    When a user interacts with any of the platforms, we may collect certain data about that user.  This data falls into 2 broad categories: (i) data about a user themselves, which the user gives us; and (ii) data about the user, or the way a user interacts with the platforms or Services, which is collected by us electronically (collectively "<strong>User Information</strong>").
    </br></br>
    We collect the following User Information in accordance with applicable law:
    <ul>
      <li>information that users provide to us, directly or via a third-party registration service for the purpose of registering with us or our group companies;</li>
      <li>a user's entry details for a competition or promotion;</li>
      <li>information users provide to us when users interact with our customer service team;</li>
      <li>information users provide when users participate in our surveys or marketing promotions;</li>
      <li>information from a user's social media profile to populate their profile on our platforms, and where the user chooses to register with us using their social media login(s);</li>
      <li>information users provide relating to reviews or ratings, favourite sports, tournaments, teams, events or personalities, and/or other subjects of interest to sports fans;</li>
      <li>information about user interactions with our platforms, and any direct communications the user receives from us (such as emails);</li>
      <li>device IDs or unique identifiers, location data, device and software characteristics (such as type and configuration), connection information, statistics on page views, referral URLs, ad data, website and app navigation, IP address and standard web log information;</li>
      <li>the language choices made by users in relation to their use of the Service, which may include information relating to their location when using the Service;</li>
      <li>the details of any third-party digital property (such as a website) that referred or linked a user to the platforms, together with information about how a user interacted with any online and email marketing campaigns related to the Service;</li>
      <li>information and communications on forums on the platforms, including chat rooms and message boards; and
      information about how users behave on our platforms (such as the type of content they view, how frequently, at what times, etc.).</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
  </p>
  <p>
    We may also collect personal information from a variety of third-party sources. These include social networks (subject to the user's privacy settings and the privacy policy of the social network), service providers which allow us to verify, enhance or supplement the User Information collected on our platforms, and business partners to whom we are offering a service.
  </p>
<li class="main-list">How & why we use the data we collect</li>
  <p>
    We use the User Information for three main purposes: 
    <ol>
      <li>to operate and improve the platforms and to ensure that we can provide the Services;</li>
      <li>(ii) to optimise the content on the platforms; and</li>
      <li>(iii) send marketing and show advertising to our users.</li>
    </ol>
    </br>
    More specifically, we will use the User Information to do one or more of the following things:
    <ol class="alphabet-with-parentheses">
      <li>administer our platforms;</li>
      <li>provide the Service requested by the user;</li>
      <li>improve the browsing experience by personalizing the Service to the user;</li>
      <li>recommend goods, services or promotions which may be of interest to the user or contact users in order to conduct market research (with the consent of the user, where necessary). For these purposes, we will create a profile about your interests and preferences which will enable us to increase our advertising and communication relevance;</li>
      <li>prevent, detect and investigate potentially prohibited or illegal activities, including fraud, cheating, and money laundering and enforce our terms;</li>
      <li>to notify users about changes to our Service;</li>
      <li>send out email alerts, text message notifications or device notifications in relation to our Service;</li>
      <li>send users prizes won via the platforms, and supply services purchased via our platforms;</li>
      <li>send notices and invoices to users, and collect payments from them;</li>
      <li>provide third parties with statistical and other information about our users as required to operate the platforms or Services;</li>
      <li>deal with enquiries and complaints;</li>
      <li>provide our commercial partners with information about users’ use of co-branded services, including historical use data;</li>
      <li>comply with any legal or regulatory requirements and otherwise respond to any relevant regulator or competent authority as required by law;</li>
      <li>understand user trends and patterns; and</li>
      <li>develop aggregate analysis in respect of our users and business intelligence that enables us to operate, protect, make informed decisions and report on the performance of our business.</li>
    </ol>
    </br>
  </p>
  <p>
    The platforms we operate are designed to attract as many users as possible. In our case, our users are typically sports fans or interested in sports news, other sports-related content but may also extend to lifestyle content. The creation of this content, and the work that goes into ensuring that the platforms continue to be digital sports destinations, are funded by advertising revenues which we receive as a result of showing users advertising or other sponsored or branded content on the platforms.  We have a legitimate interest in ensuring that we deliver this advertising in a responsible way, and in allowing us to deliver it to the users most likely to be interested in it, and in doing so we employ User Information, such as the user's location, how the user engages with the platforms and the content that the user views.
    </br></br>
    More specifically, in relation to advertising:
    <ul>
      <li>we employ User Information to select and deliver advertising that appears on our platforms, and to allow third parties (such as ad servers) to do this on our behalf;</li>
      <li>we employ User Information to select and deliver advertising to users based on the way the user has interacted with our platforms, and to share that information with third parties to allow them to do so; </li>
      <li>we may pass User Information to service providers, such as Google, to allow them to provide services on our behalf or to partner with us in selecting and serving ads for our advertising partners;</li>
      <li>we may pass User Information to advertisers or third-party publishers to allow us to report on the advertising displayed to our users and how users interacted with it; and</li>
      <li>we will not employ User Information to make qualitative judgments about individual users, nor make automated decisions in relation to users which could have a significant or legal effect on them, nor will we knowingly engage any third party to do so.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
<li class="main-list">Cookies</li>
  <p>
    Much of the User Information that we collect, and most of the information we employ in connection with advertising, is obtained via the use of cookies and similar technologies.  Cookies are usually a string of numbers and/or letters that a platform transfers to a user's hard drive. Similar technologies include pixel tags and web storage and other technologies, and we refer to all these things as “cookies” in this section. The cookies enable the platforms to "remember" you, either for the duration of your visit (session cookies) or for repeat visits (persistent cookies).
    </br></br>
    On the platforms, we use the following types of cookies:

    <strong class="red-sub-heading">ANNEX TO PRIVACY NOTICE - INFORMATION FOR EEA, SWISS AND UK INDIVIDUALS</strong>
    </br></br>
    In order to comply with data privacy regulations in the EEA, Switzerland and the UK, we provide additional information to our EEA, Switzerland and UK based users.
    </br></br>
    <strong class="black-sub-heading">What is personal data?</strong>
    </br></br>
    “<strong>Personal data</strong>” is information about you (a “<strong>data subject</strong>”) the use of which is governed by applicable data protection laws. It will include any information from which you can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as your name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or other information about your identity. Most User Information will constitute personal data. 
    </br></br>
    <strong class="black-sub-heading">Who is responsible for your personal data?</strong>
    </br></br>
    Sporting News Enterprises UK Limited</br>
    Company Number 12988496</br>
    73 Cornhill </br>
    London EC3V 3QQ, </br>
    United Kingdom</br>
    </br></br>
    <strong class="black-sub-heading">What is the legal basis on which we rely to process your personal data?</strong>
    </br></br>
    On some occasions, we process your personal data with your consent (for example, when you agree to participate in our surveys and other activities or when you give us consent to send you marketing communications (adopting a “double-opt-in” where required) or to deal with your enquiries, as set out in paragraph 3 (d).
    </br></br>
    On other occasions, we process your personal data when we need to do this in order to fulfil a contract with you (for example, to make available to you the requested content or for billing purposes) or in order to take steps prior to entering into a contract (for example, verifying your information), as set out in paragraph 3 letters (a), (b), (c), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j) and (k). 
    </br></br>
    We also process your personal data when it is in our legitimate interests to do this and when these interests are not overridden by your data protection rights, as set out in paragraph 3 letters (c), (e), (j), (k), (l), (n) and (o). For example, we may process your personal data in our legitimate interests to ensure that the platforms and Services are provided efficiently and in a user-friendly and personalised manner taking into account user feedback, data and profiles, unless consent is required for any such processing under applicable law. We will process personal data to ensure the security of our business and the information of our users, and to ensure the proper and efficient administration of our business.
    </br></br>
    Finally, we will process your personal data where we are required to do this by law (for example, where we have to fulfil anti-money laundering requirements or disclose information under a court order), as set out in paragraph 3 letters (f), (g), (k) and (m).
    </br></br>
    <strong class="black-sub-heading">How long do we keep data?</strong>
    </br></br>
    We keep your data for only as long as required to provide you with the necessary Services and to carry out the processing set out in this notice, and in line with its obligation under applicable law. This means that we will generally not keep your personal information for longer than six years following your last interaction with us, and the retention period will often be shorter. For example, we may keep your information for marketing purposes for a period of 3 years following the termination or expiry of our relationship, or your last contact with us.
    </br></br>
    <strong class="black-sub-heading">Your rights</strong>
    </br></br>
    Data subjects may ask us for a copy of their information, to correct it, erase it or to transfer it to other organisations at their request. Data subjects also have rights to object to some processing including profiling and, where we have asked for their consent to process the data subject’s data, to withdraw this consent. In particular, data subjects have the right to object to direct marketing at any time. Where a data subject withdraws their consent, this will not affect the legitimacy of the processing conducted prior to your request.  Where we process data because we have a legitimate interest in doing so (as explained above), the data subject has a right to object to this. Where we make a decision based solely on automated processing which significantly affects the data subject, he or she may have the right to contest the decision, express his or her point of view and obtain human intervention.
    </br></br>
    These rights may be limited in some situations – for example, where we can demonstrate that we have a legal requirement to process your data.
    </br></br>
    Please use the contact information set out in our Contact section above.
    </br></br>
    We hope that we can satisfy queries you may have about the way we process your data. However, if you have unresolved concerns you also have the right to complain to your local data protection authority.
