Here, the transitive verb is defined as \"aimer\", but the examples listed of how to express that love show how rarely it is used. According to Larousse, when talking about love for a sport or a food, the proper French term would be \u003Cem\u003Epassion\u003C\u002Fem\u003E.

Men don't think twice about carrying a woman's suitcase down the metro stairs, and, as for being romantic, it's ingrained in a culture that perfected chocolate, invented Champagne and built the opulent Art Nouveau Pont Alexandre III bridge.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"travel\u002Farticle\u002F20210613-why-the-french-rarely-say-i-love-you-4"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"Image","iFrameType":"","image":[],"imageAlignment":"centre","imageOrientation":"landscape","id":"travel\u002Farticle\u002F20210613-why-the-french-rarely-say-i-love-you-5"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003EIt's not just about romance, either.

Of the six house cocktails, Deimos (a mix of bourbon, oolong, green walnut and brined black sesame honey) or Ariel (vodka, li hing mui, almond milk, pomelo and osmanthus) are just some of the interesting concoctions regularly offered.\u003Cem\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWebsite: \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.moongatelounge.com\"\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ewww.moongatelounge.com\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAddress: 28 Waverly Pl, San Francisco, CA 94108\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003Cem\u003EPhone: +1 415-857-9688\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003Cem\u003EInstagram: \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.instagram.com\u002Fmoongatelounge\u002F?hl=en\"\u003E\u003Cem\u003E@moongatelounge\u002F\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"travel\u002Farticle\u002F20231119-a-tour-of-san-franciscos-best-cocktail-bars-from-mixologist-josh-harris-12"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"Image","iFrameType":"","image":[],"imageAlignment":"left","imageAltText":"Li Po in San Francisco","imageOrientation":"landscape","id":"travel\u002Farticle\u002F20231119-a-tour-of-san-franciscos-best-cocktail-bars-from-mixologist-josh-harris-13"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E5.

But after the defeat of the far-left guerrilla group Shining Path in the early 1990s, visitors flocked to the trail. In 2001, new Inca Trail regulations required permits for trekkers as well as porters; today, 300 porters and guides support 200 tourists daily.

Llamas run free and birds soar overhead, and the ancient ruins of the Inca world sprinkle the verdant, cloud-cloaked mountainsides.

In fact, the term \"kulfi\" derives from the Persian word \"qulfe\", which were conical shaped cups that would have been used to mould desserts. At least since 13th Century, summer drinks like sherbet were chilled using the ice and snow procured from the Himalayas, but it was the Arab technique of employing saltpetre to make ice that the imperial cooks used to prepare kulfi &ndash; by freezing a mixture of condensed milk, pistachios and saffron.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the advent of technology, the ancient technique of using saltpetre has been replaced with modern commercial refrigerators and pushcart freezers.

Considering the influence of Persian cuisine, it is possible that the concept of the frozen dessert may have originated in the cooler regions of Persia and Samarkand, where similar summer desserts like \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bastanitehran.com\u002Fmaking-faloodeh-recipe\" target=\"_blank\"\u003E\u003Cem\u003Efaloodeh\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E (also known as \u003Cem\u003Epaloodeh\u003C\u002Fem\u003E) and sorbet existed as early as 400-500 BCE.

The mixture is usually flavoured milk (cardamom, saffron, pistachio, rose petals) that is slowly cooked in a \u003Cem\u003Ekadai\u003C\u002Fem\u003E (wok), which reduces the milk and eventually condenses it. The slow cooking makes the sugar caramelise. The mixture is poured in moulds and then frozen. To speed up the process, the mould is submerged in ice and salt. This freezing method gives kulfi its distinctive smooth, soft, creamy taste, free of crystals.\"&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIce cream, on the other hand, Gupta explained, is a frozen dairy dessert prepared by churning milk with various flavours, sugar and cream, followed by freezing. Of course, the serving style of kulfi and ice-cream also differ: kulfi is de-moulded, cut into half and topped with syrups, nuts and saffron, while ice-cream is scooped and usually served in bowls or cones.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is one thing kulfi and ice cream have in common though: they have both been subject to innumerable experiments and developments.

The pastry was born out of necessity when the baker, Yves Ren&eacute; Scordia, who owned a shop in the town, needed to replenish his stock in a hurry after selling out of cakes.

Lukken contain more sugar than other types of waffles and since sugar was once costly, lukken were associated with celebrations and the holidays, especially New Year's Day. \"Sugar makes these waffles crisp, caramelised and long-lasting,\" said Ysewijn.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENo one knows exactly when the first waffle was invented, but Ysewijn notes the earliest known waffle iron in the Low Countries (this includes Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and parts of northern France and western Germany) is displayed in the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.museabrugge.be\u002Fen\u002Fvisit-our-museums\u002Four-museums-and-monuments\u002Fgruuthusemuseum\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EGruuthusemuseum\u003C\u002Fa\u003E in Bruges, Belgium, and dates from between 1430 and 1450.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first waffle recipes were recorded in books in the early 16th Century in the region of Belgium that is now Flanders.

One of the cakes was the \u003Cem\u003Ekongekage\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, a Danish cake that used a lot of almonds. Since the nuts were pricey, she adapted the recipe and cut back on the quantity of nuts. In time, the cake grew in popularity and the recipe was tweaked as it passed around homes.

She then riffed on their recipes, applying her passion for seasonality as well as little tweaks to enhance the flavours.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\"I'm always interested in elevating the ingredient to be better than it is on its own.

Ptak also believes that the cake is a \"really good example\" of her melding of English and Californian styles.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\"It's such a classic, beloved recipe of the English teatime&hellip; and [the English] most commonly like a strawberry jam,\" said Ptak. \"And I'm like, 'Oh my God, you can do any jam [in] any season&hellip; it could be rhubarb, it could be plums, it could be, you know, berries. It could be anything.'\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen it comes to making a great Victoria sponge, Ptak offers a few tips. One is to always bake it at a low temperature for a long time, which results in a \"really nice flat top\" that is essential for effectively stacking the cake layers neatly. And as someone who detests what she calls \"funnel-like puddles of air\" in her sponge, Ptak also recommends smacking the cake down on the counter before putting it into the oven.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\"I think people are always afraid that they're going to make a cake fall or collapse. But it's actually a really good technique to just get out a few of those big air pockets,\" she said.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing Ptak says about Victoria sponge is that it's a very easy cake to make, so long as you weigh your ingredients (versus measuring by volume), since the eggs, flour, butter and sugar all weigh exactly the same (250g, in the case of Ptak's recipe).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"travel\u002Farticle\u002F20230427-violet-bakerys-new-cookbook-love-is-a-pink-cake-2"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"Video","iFrameType":"","videoImageAlign":"centre","videoUrn":[],"id":"travel\u002Farticle\u002F20230427-violet-bakerys-new-cookbook-love-is-a-pink-cake-3"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca id=\"Brown Sugar Victoria sponge recipe\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBrown Sugar Victoria sponge recipe\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EBy Claire Ptak\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"Main\"\u003EThis golden brown, less refined version of Victoria sponge has a wonderful texture.
