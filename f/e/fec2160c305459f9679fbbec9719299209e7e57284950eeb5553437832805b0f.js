bc_json305({"recommendationBlock":[],"trackingPixel":""})r the Thunder tonight RJ attacking,

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:10.710
oh and a vicious throw down. He has been

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:14.829
quiet over to Trent Toronto's got nothing going. Trent

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:17.329
tough shot fading to his lef> 00:00:24.449
is good defenses

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:28.269
kind of defense for a little bit over 12 seconds

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:31.408
and that's a whole lot of time for the Raptors

00:00:31.638 --> 00:00:33.728
to try to make something happen and they did not

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.950
get the ball just slightly below the three point line

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:41.069
. So kudos to the defense, everybody locking up

00:00:41.098 --> 00:00:43.728
on whoever had the basketball and why not with your

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.329
best defender and top scorer and the guy that's leading

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.810
the NBA and steals SG A Barnes just gave it

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:54.719
up. Didn't make a move, didn't drive,

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.700
meeting up with Patrick Mahomes on Sunday. A little

00:00:58.709 --> 00:01:00.289
nervous about that nice pass coming out of the time

00:01:00.298 --> 00:01:03.279
out. That is a beauty, a little bit

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:04.558
of shine to it. Setting up Chet Holgren and

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.709
Mark de draws up a beauty out of the,

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:11.870
this was out of the time out. How do

00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:15.939
you wrap that around the defender car also so special

00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:21.879
. They put an extra man in defense back door

00:01:21.948 --> 00:01:23.730
cut Wiggins off the pass from G and we are

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:29.019
tied at 110 on a beautiful out of bounds play

00:01:29.888 --> 00:01:34.510
. Even giddy wide open and somehow it's Wiggins squeaking

00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:37.730
through all that congestion. And how about that laser

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:42.879
pass by none other than Josh Gitty on time on

00:01:42.888 --> 00:01:48.888
target showing a whole lot of confidence, you know

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.799
, and there are so many variations on this play

00:01:49.808 --> 00:01:52.650
, folks and you know, you're trying to get

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.189
the ball with your best score, which is ST

00:01:55.198 --> 00:01:57.870
a the wizard shot 52% from the field. Phoenix

00:01:57.879 --> 00:02:01.859
shot 63 paced by Beal with 14 and oh,

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.819
did he allowed me to reintroduce myself to Drew?

00:02:07.618 --> 00:02:09.508
He used to be known as Air Nine. Now

00:02:09.518 --> 00:02:14.038
we're just gonna call it. He's like Denny a

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:19.300
fight eight,? Like that too. Then a

00:02:20.288 --> 00:02:22.899
green getting the angle. Can't put it in.

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:28.028
Shen keeping it alive back to Greened by mcdaniels.

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:30.919
I mean, he just signed up to coach the

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:34.479
Milwaukee Bucks, uh, mid season, 0,

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.288
10 a little show time, but coming up a

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.368
little bit hobbled and we'll see what his landing looked

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:50.569
like here and they do it on the dribble or

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.868
be in the pass. Halliburton, the ball fake

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:59.069
now gets it into from the seven footer was out

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:00.919
of bounds. Brandon come from the weak side reads

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:06.710
that perfectly climb the ladder and send Turner away.

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:15.219
That's clears his body, what? Just under four

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:19.199
minutes to play? Second quarter Jokic and there's the

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.538
fake of the century. This is the pump fake

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.819
of the century. That's Larry Bird right there.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.750
He, he a to for sure that was Kamara

00:03:30.008 --> 00:03:30.580
. They kept him in there and did a little

00:03:30.588 --> 00:03:34.949
gamble with him. He picks up the foul in

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.229
the end one opportunity. I mean, was just

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.520
turning around staring at that. Her used to do

00:03:38.528 --> 00:03:43.169
that all the time. They get back into the

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:44.969
lane, he gives it right back to him.

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:46.229
Shea this time wants to drive down the lane and

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.679
SG A elevates at the rim for the jam ready

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.788
for the second half here from paycom Center coming up

<meta name='description' content='One of the nation&#8217;s largest real estate brokerages has agreed to pay $70 million as part of a proposed settlement to resolve more than a dozen lawsuits across the country over agent commissions. The agreement was filed Thursday with federal courts overseeing lawsuits in Illinois and Missouri. It also calls on Keller Williams Realty Inc. to take several steps aimed at providing homebuyers and sellers with more transparency over the commissions paid to real estate agents. In October, a federal jury in Missouri found that Keller Williams and several other defendants conspired to require that home sellers pay a homebuyer&#8217;s agent commission in violation of federal antitrust law.' /><!-- WP SEO -->

<p>LOS ANGELES (AP) &#8212; One of the nation&#8217;s largest real estate brokerages has agreed to pay $70 million as part of a proposed settlement to resolve more than a dozen lawsuits across the country over agent commissions.</p>
<p>The agreement, filed Thursday with federal courts overseeing lawsuits in Illinois and Missouri, also calls on Keller Williams Realty Inc. to take several steps aimed at providing homebuyers and sellers with more transparency over the commissions paid to real estate agents. </p>
<p>&#8220;We think it&#8217;s a tremendous victory for homeowners and homebuyers across the country,&#8221; said Michael Ketchmark, one of the attorneys representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuits. </p>
<div class="s2nPlayer k-udYx5Byq" data-type="float"></div>
<p>The central claim put forth in the lawsuits is that the country&#8217;s biggest real estate brokerages engage in practices that unfairly force homeowners to pay artificially inflated agent commissions when they sell their home.</p>
<p>In October, a federal jury in Missouri found that the National Association of Realtors and several large real estate brokerages, including Keller Williams, conspired to require that home sellers pay homebuyers&#8217; agent commission in violation of federal antitrust law.</p>				<div class="dfp-ad dfp-outstream_video" id="div-gpt-ad-outstream_video" style="visibility:hidden">
					<div class="htlad-outstream_video" data-unit='baltimoresun.com/business/outstream_video' data-targeting=''></div>
				</div>
<p>The jury ordered the defendants to pay almost $1.8 billion in damages. If treble damages &#8212; which allows plaintiffs to potentially receive up to three times actual or compensatory damages &#8212; are awarded, then the defendants may have to pay more than $5 billion. </p>
<p>More than a dozen similar lawsuits are pending against the real estate brokerage industry.</p>				<div class="dfp-ad dfp-cube_article" id="div-gpt-ad-cube_article" style="visibility:hidden">
					<div class="htlad-cube_article" data-unit='baltimoresun.com/business/cube_article' data-targeting=''></div>
				</div>
<p>Moving Keller Williams out from under that cloud of litigation and uncertainty motivated the company to pursue the proposed settlement, which would release the company, its franchisees and agents from similar agent commission lawsuits nationwide. The company based in Austin, Texas, operates more than 1,100 offices with some 180,000 agents.</p>
<p>&#8220;We came to the decision to settle with careful consideration for the immediate and long-term well-being of our agents, our franchisees and the business models they depend on,&#8221; Gary Keller, the company&#8217;s executive chairman, wrote in a companywide email Thursday. &#8220;It was a decision to bring stability, relief and the freedom for us all to focus on our mission without distractions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among the terms of its proposed settlement, Keller Williams agreed to make clear that its agents let clients know that commissions are negotiable, and that there isn&#8217;t a set minimum that clients are required to pay, nor one set by law.</p>
<p>The company also agreed to make certain that agents who work with prospective homebuyers disclose their compensation structure, including any &#8220;cooperative compensation,&#8221; which is when a seller&#8217;s agent offers to compensate the agent that represents a buyer for their services.</p>
<p>As part of the settlement, which must be approved by the court, Keller Williams agents will no longer be required to be members of the National Association of Realtors or follow the trade association&#8217;s guidelines.</p>
<p>Two other large real estate brokerages agreed to similar settlement terms last year. In their respective pacts, Anywhere Real Estate Inc. agreed to pay $83.5 million, while Re/Max agreed to pay $55 million.</p>
