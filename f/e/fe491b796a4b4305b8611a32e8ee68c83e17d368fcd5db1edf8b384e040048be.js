                                                <p>We automatically collect User Information when Users interact with our Services that appear on our Customers’ websites and digital properties. Like most other web-based services, we collect this User Information through cookies and other technologies. Taboola collects only pseudonymized data, which means we do not know who you are because we do not know or process your name, email address, or other identifiable data. User Information that we collect includes, but is not limited to, Information about a User’s device and operating system, IP address, the web pages accessed by Users within our Customers’ websites, the link that led a User to a Customer’s website, the dates and times a User accesses a Customers’ website, event information (e.g., system crashes), general location information (e.g., city and state), hashed email addresses (when made available by the User), and gender (when made available by the User). In the Taboola News suite of tools, we also collect in-app User behaviors (e.g. online status, browsing activity, and clicks) and implicit non-precise device location inferred from search queries (when enabled by the User) and SIM cards or IP addresses. We ask our Customers to obtain consent on our behalf, where required by applicable data protection laws, for us to collect this User Information. We may also obtain Information about you from our <a href="https://www.taboola.com/policies/data-partners" rel="noopener noreferrer">data partners</a>.</p>

                                                <p>We use User Information for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Providing our Service</strong></em>. We may use User Information to provide our Services to Users and our Customers.</li>
<li><em><strong>Tailoring content</strong></em>. We may use User Information to tailor the content and information that we may send or display to Users; to retarget content to Users through our Services and elsewhere; and to otherwise personalize your experiences while using our Services. For more information about how we tailor our content see information below about our <a href="https://www.taboola.com/policies/privacy-policy#interest-based-advertising">Interest Based Advertising</a>.</li>
<li><em><strong>Tailoring content across multiple devices</strong></em>. We may use User Information to improve a unique User’s experience across multiple browsers and devices (such as smartphones, tablets, or other viewing devices) by providing better targeted ad campaigns to that User. For instance, should we recognize a User on a web browser, we may want to provide that User similar or personalized content on mobile apps, as well. To do this, we identify unique Users across devices, or we may sync cookies and identifiers with our service providers or Customers that do this, to help our Customers enhance their own data and data segments, or to help them target the right audience.</li>
<li><em><strong>Offering our Customers data segments that help target content and advertisements for topics, products, and services that may interest you.</strong></em> A data segment is a grouping of users who share one or more attributes (e.g., travel enthusiasts). We offer a number of data segments, both proprietary and from our <a href="https://www.taboola.com/policies/data-partners" rel="noopener noreferrer">data partners</a>, to our Customers so that they may better target Users who are more likely to be interested in their content and advertisements. Taboola does not knowingly create segments that are based upon what we consider to be sensitive information (for example, Personal Data revealing your racial or ethnic origin or your religious affiliations, or Personal Data concerning your sensitive health information, sex life or sexual orientation, or genetic or biometric data). In connection with our Services, our Customers may use these <a href="https://www.taboola.com/pdf/health-related-segments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standard health-related segments</a> about non-sensitive conditions such as an inferred interest in health and wellness or over the counter medications. In addition, Taboola offers our Customers <a href="https://www.taboola.com/pdf/political-related-segments/">standard political-related segments</a> that may indicate general political sentiment, interest in specific political issues, and political party affiliation.</li>

<ul>
<li><em><strong>Taboola Affiliates</strong></em>. We may disclose User Information to any current or future Affiliates, parent companies, or subsidiaries to process for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</li>
<li><em><strong>Taboola service providers</strong></em>. We may disclose User Information to vendors, service providers, agents, contractors, or others who perform functions (e.g., maintenance, data analysis, customer relationship management, email marketing, surveys, credit card processing, data hosting, or fraud detection) on our behalf.</li>
<li><em><strong>Unaffiliated third parties</strong></em>. We may disclose User Information to other unaffiliated third parties, specifically with (i) our <a href="https://www.taboola.com/policies/data-partners" rel="noopener noreferrer">data partners</a>, so that we can connect you with relevant content by allowing our advertisers to target specific audience segments, and (ii) our <a href="https://www.taboola.com/policies/programmatic-demand-and-supply-partners" rel="noopener noreferrer">programmatic demand and supply partners</a>, so that we can serve you with tailored advertisements.</li>
<li><em><strong>Customers</strong></em>. We may disclose User Information to Customers where relevant to the Service we provide those Customers. For example, we may provide publishers with information about the viewing and click-through patterns of the content they publish and may provide advertisers with information about conversion rates for analytics purposes.</li>

                                                <p>Through our Services, including our Services on Customer websites, we may provide advertisements to you based on your recent browsing behavior across different Customer websites, browsers, or devices. For example, if on a first online visit, you browse on website A, then on a subsequent visit to website B, you may see content personalized based on your browsing history on website A. For example, if a user visits a clothing retail site, she might see clothing-related ads on another site she visits.</p>
<p>In order to target advertisements to you for products and services that may interest you, we may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), HTML5 local storage, and other technologies. For more information about how we use these technologies, please refer to our <a href="/cookie-policy" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>
<p>We may also work with third parties such as ad networks, which are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to websites that you have visited in the past. These advertisers will deliver you targeted advertisements for products and services that may interest you. Third-party ad networks, our advertiser Customers (and their content providers and agents), and/or traffic measurement services may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs, and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These <a href="https://www.taboola.com/policies/third-party-cookies-and-technologies" rel="noopener noreferrer">third-party cookies and other technologies</a> are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one.</p>

<p>Please also note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because our tracking mechanisms operate at the device and browser level, to fully opt-out across devices, you will need to do so on each device and browser individually.<br />
If your browsers are configured to reject cookies, your opt-out may not be effective, since we identify your choice to opt-out based on an opt-out cookie we deliver to you. In this case, you will need to confirm that your browser is configured properly in order for the opt-out to be effective. If you are using a Safari browser on iOS11 or macOS High Sierra, you must first adjust your Privacy and Security Settings to turn off both “Prevent Cross-Site Tracking” and “Block All Cookies”, and then return to this privacy policy or your preferred opt out platform to reset your opt out preferences.</li>
<li>Taboola may use non-cookie technologies in limited cases. Like cookies, these technologies allow Taboola to recommend ads that are tailored to your interests and to remember whether you have chosen to opt-out from our Services. Please note that some web browsers may not permit you to block the use of non-cookie technologies, but you can do so by simply clicking on the Opt Out feature above in this Section 2.6.</li>
<li><em><strong>You can also opt-out of receiving targeted ads served by Taboola and other advertising companies</strong></em>.
<ul>
<li>You may use the <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NAI opt out tool</a>, which will allow you to opt out of receiving targeted ads from Taboola and from other NAI-approved member companies. The NAI also provides instructions to engage system-level mobile device opt outs in Android, iOS, and Windows Phone environments.</li>
<li>You may also visit one of the Digital Advertising Alliance affiliate websites to learn more about User choices and opting out of interest-based advertising displayed by the many member companies.

<p>Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit the DAA, DAAC or EDAA consumer choice pages, your opt out may not be effective because your browser will refuse opt-out cookies (that alert companies that you have exercised your opt-out preference).</li>

                                                <p>To understand your interests and deliver advertisements that are tailored to your interests, we may work with service providers or third parties that use their own <a href="https://www.taboola.com/policies/cookie-policy">cookies, web beacons, and other technologies</a> to collect Information about Site Visitors’ online activities, either on our Sites and/or other websites across the Internet  (“<b><strong>Taboola Ad Partners</strong></b>”). These Taboola Ad Partners include advertisers and ad networks that may collect Information about when you view or interact with one of their advertisements and may collect information regarding your activities on our Sites and your online activities over time and across different websites. Like most advertisers, Taboola works to place our advertisements where we think they will be most interesting and relevant to the recipient. One way we do this is by allowing ad networks to place their own cookies when an individual visits our Sites. This enables the ad network to recognize individuals who have previously visited the Taboola Sites. Then, if the ad network has purchased ad space on a third-party website, and recognizes that same individual visiting that third-party website, the ad network can deliver a Taboola advertisement, knowing that this individual has already expressed interest in Taboola by visiting the Taboola Sites.

<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt">5.1.2 Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data</span></h3>
<p>If you are a Customer, Site Visitor, or User from the EEA or UK, our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Data described above (also referred to in this Section 5.1 as “<strong>EEA/UK Data</strong>”) will depend on the Personal Data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.</p>
<p>However, we will normally collect Personal Data from you only (i) where we have your consent to do so, (ii) where we need the Personal Data to perform a contract with you, or (iii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Data from you or may otherwise need the Personal Data to protect your vital interests or those of another person.</p>
<p>If we ask you to provide Personal Data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your Personal Data).</p>
<p>Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.</p>
<p>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your Personal Data, including if you would like to better understand how our legitimate interests to process your data are balanced against your data protection rights and freedoms, please contact us as specified in Section 6 below.</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt">5.1.3 Your Rights to Your Information</span></h3>
<p>You have the right to request that Taboola (i) provide you with access to the Personal Data we hold about you, (ii) correct your Personal Data, (iii) export your Personal Data, (iv) delete your Personal Data, and (v) cease or restrict processing of your Personal Data. If you are a User and would like to understand what Personal Data and behavioural information Taboola holds about you, specifically, and how you can exercise any of your rights with respect to your Personal Data, please visit <a class="access-portal-link" href="https://accessrequest.taboola.com/access" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taboola’s Data Subject Access Request Portal</a>. Customers may also submit a data subject access request by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@taboola.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">privacy@taboola.com</a> so that Taboola may either respond with the relevant information or, if applicable, direct this request to, and cooperate with, your employer to respond.</p>
<p>You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your Personal Data. To learn more, please contact your local data protection authority, via the contact methods available <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt">5.1.4 EEA/UK Data Transfers</span></h3>
<p>As part of Taboola’s global operations, our data flows between the EEA, the UK, Israel, the United States, Singapore and Hong Kong, and Taboola stores Customer, User, and Visitor information in our data centers located in Israel and the United States.</p>
<p>When Taboola transfers EEA/UK Data to Taboola.com Ltd. in Israel, it relies (as applicable) on (i) the European Commission’s decision, and (ii) UK adequacy regulations that Israel provides a level of data protection that is adequate for EEA/UK Data. These allow the free transfer of EEA/UK Data to Israel without the need for additional data transfer mechanisms.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 16">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Similarly, when Taboola transfers any personal data from the EEA to Taboola Europe Limited in the United Kingdom, it relies on the European Commission&#8217;s decision that the UK provides a level of data protection that is adequate for personal data from the EEA.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Beyond that, when Taboola transfers EEA/UK Data to other countries then, if those countries do not have a European Commission adequacy finding and are not the subject of UK adequacy regulations (as applicable), Taboola implements <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Standard Contractual Clauses</a> approved by the European Commission and/or competent UK authorities (as applicable) to protect the transferred data. The Standard Contractual Clauses are contractual privacy and security commitments that are entered between companies that transfer personal data outside of the EEA.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 16">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>In particular, non-EEA/UK Taboola Affiliates, like Taboola, Inc. in the United States, have accordingly adopted Standard Contractual Clauses to ensure the legality, privacy, and security of the data flows necessary to provide, maintain, and develop our services.</p>

<p><strong>5.6.4 Thailand Data Transfers</strong></p>
<p>Taboola transfers data outside of Thailand. Taboola has in place an Inter Group Data Transfer Agreement across its international entities, which is based on the EEA’s standard model clauses.</p>
<p>As part of Taboola’s global operations, our data flows between Thailand, the EEA, the United States, Israel, and Hong Kong. To ensure that Thailand Data is adequately protected when transferred outside of Thailand, the Personal Data Protection Act, B.E. 2562 mandates that such transfers take place using certain legal mechanisms.</p>
<p>When transferring Thailand data elsewhere, Taboola relies on Standard Contractual Clauses, set forth by the European Commission, that outline contractual privacy and security commitments between companies that transfer personal data (for example, from Taboola (Thailand) Limited to Taboola, Inc.). Taboola, Inc. and its Affiliates have accordingly adopted Standard Contractual Clauses to ensure the legality, privacy, and security of the data flows necessary to provide, maintain, and develop our services.</p>
<p>Note: Taboola currently stores Customer, User, and Visitor Information in our data centers located in the United States and Israel.</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                <h3 id="notice-to-individuals-in-brazil">

<p><strong>5.7.2 Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>If you are a Customer, Site Visitor, or User from Brazil, under the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados federal law 13,709/2018 (the “LGPD”), our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Data described above (also referred to in this Section 5.4 as “Brazil Data”) will depend on the Personal Data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.</p>
<p>However, we will normally collect Personal Data from you only (i) where we have your consent to do so, (ii) where we need the Personal Data to perform a contract with you, or (iii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Data from you or may otherwise need the Personal Data to protect your vital interests or those of another person.</p>

<p>Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), a notice will be provided to you in our disclosure statement.</p>
<p>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your Personal Data, including if you would like to better understand how our legitimate interests to process your data are balanced against your data protection rights and freedoms, please contact us as specified in Section 6 below.</p>

<p>Brazilian data subjects can file a complaint in relation to the LGPD with Brazil’s National Data Protection Authority (the “ANPD”), but please note that the Presidential Decree establishing the ANPD is not yet in effect.

<p><strong>5.8.4 PRC Data Transfers</strong></p>
<p>To provide Taboola’s Services, Personal Information about individuals in the PRC is collected by a server in Hong Kong, and our data then flows between Hong Kong, Israel, the EEA, the UK, the United States, and Singapore.

<p>When Taboola transfers Personal Information about individuals in the PRC to Taboola.com Ltd. in Israel, it relies (as applicable) on standard contractual clauses as set forth by the European Commission. In particular, non-PRC Taboola Affiliates, like Taboola, Inc. in the United States, have accordingly adopted Standard Contractual Clauses to ensure the legality, privacy, and security of the data flows necessary to provide, maintain, and develop our services.</p>
