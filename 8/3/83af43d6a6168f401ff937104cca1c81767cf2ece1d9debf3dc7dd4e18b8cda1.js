I'm also interested in quirky characters and the unsung heroes who make Tampa tick.

Later on, I moved into freelance photography, taking pictures for local news agencies. That led to a career change after I caught the attention of photo editors at the then-St. Petersburg Times. I joined the staff on June 6, 2006 (and no, I’m not superstitious about all those 6s). I became one of the first journalists in the area to use drones, and now, that work has been celebrated and seen around the world. I specialize in covering breaking news, from the ground and in the air. Protests and parades. Hurricanes and wildfires. Sinkholes and speeding cars. I also live-stream events for a growing digital audience. I’m a husband, a father of three and a dog dad.","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"affiliations":"","bio":"Luis Santana is a staff photographer.

I'm also interested in quirky characters and the unsung heroes who make Tampa tick.

Alex Rizo was told that a bill he is championing — one that could bring a glitzy Las Vegas-style casino to the Fontainebleau Miami Beach — may soon start gaining traction. “That’s the rumor,” Rizo told a Miami Herald reporter after he was told by House Commerce Committee Chairman Bob Rommel that the bill would likely appear on the committee’s agenda next week. While a potential committee hearing is only the first step in the legislative process, the scheduling development appears to be the result of weeks of intense behind-the-scenes lobbying efforts to advance bills that appear tailored to bring a casino to the Fontainebleau. The central players in the casino palace intrigue include Gov. Ron DeSantis, House Speaker Paul Renner, and entities representing Jeffrey Soffer, the billionaire owner of the iconic hotel. Lining up to fight the bill is a group of high-powered casino opponents including billionaire auto magnate Norman Braman, developer Armando Codina and GOP megadonor Ken Griffin, a new Miami resident.

Ron DeSantis’ spectacular campaign flameout, there’s lots of blame to go around. Much has been said and written about the candidate’s awkward personal style, his campaign’s poor strategy and the graft of his high-priced political consultants. But his failure has led some to wonder a more fundamental question about the governor: What if he was always overrated? Being a Republican in Florida is, arguably, quite easy. Republicans have dominated statewide for going on three decades, building a roaring political machine that has ground Democrats into irrelevance. An obsequious Legislature filled with few critical thinkers is ready to do the bidding of any popular Republican governor. Natural disasters give governors a ready platform to prove their competence. What if DeSantis overrated his own political acumen because of his frictionless Tallahassee existence? In a story that will feature political experts, elected officials and activists, we will dig into the question of DeSantis’ rated-ness, with plenty of push back to the premise from both supporters and detractors alike.","internal_note":"","story_length":{"character_encoding":"UTF-16","character_count_actual":7758,"inch_count_actual":45,"inch_count_planned":50,"word_count_actual":1229,"line_count_actual":314}},"display_date":"2024-01-27T11:00:00Z","headlines":{"tablet":"","print":"Was Ron DeSantis overrated?","meta_title":"","native":"","web":"","mobile":"","basic":"Was Ron DeSantis overrated?

When I’m not writing about food or restaurants I’m probably talking about food or restaurants, or, you know, actually eating food at restaurants. I was never a picky eater, and never had a chance to be: Growing up in the Pacific Northwest, saying ‘no’ to things like geoduck sashimi or fiddlehead fern pesto just wasn’t cool. Instead, I tried everything, and have ever since. I studied journalism at the University of Washington and cooking at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris. I most recently was the restaurant critic and dining editor of Gambit Weekly in New Orleans - another place where people love to eat and drink. When I’m not eating, I’m probably scuba diving and tagging along with spearfishers, hoping they’ll spear some dinner for me.
