If you give your agreement, additional characteristics (e.g. the installed font or screen resolution) can also be combined to improve precision of the probabilistic identifier.Such an identifier is considered probabilistic because several devices can share the same characteristics and Internet connection. It may be used to recognise your device across e.g. web pages from the same site or across multiple sites or apps.","CustomGroupId":"IAB2V2DC_4"},{"Id":9,"Name":"Precise location data","Description":"Your precise location within a radius of less than 500 meters based on your GPS coordinates.
