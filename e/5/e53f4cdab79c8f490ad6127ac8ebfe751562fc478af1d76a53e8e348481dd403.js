1
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.600
- Artificial intelligence is smart,

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.480
real smart.

3
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.080
And like most smart things,

4
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.960
it's getting smarter every hour,

5
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.520
every second,

6
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.680
every millisecond.

7
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.560
You get the idea.

8
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.720
Now we know all the benefits of AI,

9
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.520
the question is,

10
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.760
what about the risks?

11
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.840
Like privacy invasions,

12
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.880
prejudiced assumptions

13
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.560
and loss of human control.

14
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.120
Well, you've seen the headlines.

15
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.680
But we are taking action.

16
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.720
AI may be smart,

17
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.720
but people are smarter.

18
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.880
That's why we're taking a vow,

19
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.920
a serious commitment to
make the knowns of AI known.

20
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.240
Let's call this commitment
the BCG AI Code of Conduct.

21
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.960
The first of its kind.

22
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.560
A map for others to follow.

23
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.040
Let's raise the industry's
ethical standard

24
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.200
by being accountable for
what we make and make happen.

25
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.000
Let's design elegant and efficient AI

26
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.440
that maximizes value and
minimizes harm to the environment.

27
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.920
Let's spread our knowledge

28
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.600
by sharing our AI impact
studies with our clients.

29
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.200
Let's grow our clients'
businesses the right way

30
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.880
with solutions that boost machine learning

31
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.640
and human thriving.

32
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.800
This is not a prescription
or hopeful pledge.

33
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.240
This is a commitment,

34
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.360
a commitment to balance
advanced capability

35
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.840
with basic humility,

36
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.680
a commitment to live our purpose,

37
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.400
to unlock the potential of
those who advance the world

38
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.120
by ensuring AI brings good to the world.
