With multi-collateral loans, your loan and collateral amount (calculated in USD) will be added to your previous loans. In other words, you can use the collateral of your existing loans to secure a new one. Suppose you pledge BTC and ETH worth $1 million altogether, but only borrow USDT worth $500,000.

This connection is essential for any parachain to work properly, but the number of slots is limited, and they're only available for lease. As there are a lot of projects, Polkadot has slot auctions where projects can bid on available slots. Some projects accept votes from other participants. You can support these projects by locking up your DOT. Parachain slot auctions work the same way for Kusama. However, you will need to lock KSM instead of DOT.",
    "slotauction_bot_faq_desc2": "We've made it free and easy to vote for projects. We encourage you to vote to help the Polkadot community and participate in its development. We'll cover all the fees for voting and if the project you support wins, you'll get all the rewards for voting. Furthermore, you'll get exclusive rewards from us and from project teams if you participate in early bird voting.",

Your crypto will be locked on the blockchain, but neither OKX nor the project you voted for can use them. Depending on the outcome of the auction, you'll either get your crypto back or they'll remain locked for duration of the slot lease.",
    "slotauction_bot_faq_desc5": "If the project you voted for doesn't win, you'll get the crypto you voted with back to your OKX funding account after the auction ends. If the project you voted for wins and your vote goes through, your assets will be locked on the blockchain for the entire slot lease period. It varies from 12 to 96 weeks on average. Once the lease period ends, we'll return your initial crypto plus all the project rewards to your funding account.",

We vote on your behalf every two hours after the auction starts, but we don't know when each auction ends. Therefore, if we vote on your behalf after the auction ends, your vote may not go through. If your vote doesn't go through, you'll still get the crypto you voted with back into your funding account, but without any rewards.",

After the auction ends, you'll be able to convert DOT to OKDOT and then trade it on OKX. You'll get voting rewards based on your initial amount of DOT you voted with, so any extra OKDOT purchased on OKX won't give you extra rewards. To receive your DOT, you'll need to convert OKDOT back to DOT at a 1:1 ratio when the slot lease period ends.",
    "slotauction_bot_faq_desc9": "We'll do our best to ensure voting goes smoothly. OKX helps with on-chain voting, but we can't guarantee that your votes will go through.

Establishing a value for Digital Currencies is or may become difficult as the value depends on the expectation and trust that the relevant Digital Currencies have a future use. Among other things, persistent high volatility, changes and advances in technology, fraud, theft and cyber-attacks and regulatory changes may prevent the establishment of Digital Currencies for future use and potentially render the Digital Currencies worthless.",
    "snowball_landing_subscription_agreenment_content_114": "<b>Risks relating to Technology<\/b>",
    "snowball_landing_subscription_agreenment_content_115": "There is a risk that the source code or protocol on which a Digital Currency is based may contain errors. Any such error could threaten the integrity and security of the relevant Digital Currency and the corresponding network. For example, the source code of Bitcoin or Ethereum is public and can be downloaded and inspected by anyone. Nevertheless, there could be an error in the source code that has not yet been found and rectified, or such an error could be exploited for as long as it has not been removed. There is the additional risk of an error that cannot be rectified. These risks could materially weaken the reputation of a Digital Currency, which could have an adverse effect on its market price.",
    "snowball_landing_subscription_agreenment_content_116": "Various Digital Currencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, were created in the form of open source software, i.e. as a programme that is freely available to everyone. The source code or protocol on which the Digital Currencies are based is publicly accessible and constantly being developed. The further development and acceptance of the protocol depends on a range of factors. The development of Digital Currencies could be hindered or delayed if disagreements were to arise between the participants, developers and members of the network.",
    "snowball_landing_subscription_agreenment_content_117": "New and improved versions of the source code must be confirmed by a majority of the members of the network in order to update the source code version. In the event that a majority of the network cannot be reached for the purpose of updating the source code, this could mean that urgent updates or improvements in the source code are implemented only partially or not at all. If the development of the source code is hindered or delayed, this may have an adverse effect on the value of the Digital Currency. Furthermore, there is a risk that one or more members of the network could control a majority of the network. In this case, the majority could impose changes in the source code that have an adverse effect on the market value of the Digital Currency concerned. For example, such changes could affect the verification procedure, the generation of private keys (which are necessary for the purpose of executing transactions) or the subsequent deletion of transactions. Such \"51% attacks\" could result in a general loss of confidence in the Digital Currency and the possible total cessation of trading. It may be difficult to keep track of these scenarios in some cases and they could permanently upset the equal status of the participants in the network. This would cause a loss of reputation and material adverse effects on the market value of the Digital Currency concerned. But even if such adverse scenarios are not realised, control of the majority of a network could have the same adverse effects for the market value of the Digital Currency. The risk of so- called 51% attacks is not limited to enforcing changes to the source code, but represents a general risk. Thus, a person or group of persons who make up the majority of the computing power of the network may manipulate transactions within the network (without changing the source code). The risk theoretically already exists below the 50% threshold, but is becoming increasingly unlikely. The risk of such attacks increases with the observed pooling of persons into so-called mining pools.",
    "snowball_landing_subscription_agreenment_content_118": "There is a risk that source codes or protocols could be developed further and for various reasons this could result in the Digital Currency splitting into more than one protocol (known as a \"hard fork\"). A hard fork is a basically change in the consensus rules such that computers running the old code no longer produce transactions recognized as valid by computers running the new code. A hard fork may be uncontentious, contentious, or a spin-off. An uncontentious hard fork can be viewed as a software upgrade that all (or nearly all) users agree is beneficial, such that only one network and one set of rules results from the change. In a contentious hard fork, disagreement amongst users may result in two competing incompatible networks that vie for the same brand.",
    "snowball_landing_subscription_agreenment_content_119": "In the context of a hard or soft fork, or other process that results in a division or split of a Digital Currency into multiple, possibly non-fungible, assets, it could be that trading platforms on which Digital Currencies are traded will temporarily suspend the ability to deposit or withdraw, or buy and sell, the relevant Digital Currency on that trading platform, until the risks and consequences that may result from the hard fork (such as replay attacks or network instability) have been definitively assessed. This could take several days in some circumstances, but such timeframe is in general not predictable. During any such temporary suspension, there is a risk that the market maker will not quote any bid and offer prices for the Product.",

There exists no right to compensation or ownership of any of such assets created in connection with or as a result of a fork. There is a further risk that in the case of a publicly accessible protocol, developers will not have the incentive of being remunerated for the further development of the source code. This could mean that the ongoing qualitative further development of the source code is hindered or delayed.

Therefore, the Customer could lose the total capital invested if the value of the Underlying falls to zero on the Final Fixing Date as specified in the Product Terms.\n\n<b>Risks associated to Digital Currencies<\/b>\nIt is to be noted that the Underlying is Digital Currency, including but not limited to Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), among other Digital Currencies. This means that the performance of the Underlying and the Product is affected by the performance of the Digital Currencies.\n\n<b>Risks relating to the volatility and limited trading hours of Digital Currencies<\/b>\nThe value of Digital Currencies may change significantly over the course of a day. Changes and advances in technology, fraud, theft and cyber-attacks and regulatory changes, among others, may increase volatility significantly, increasing the risk of losses in respect of Product linked to one or more Digital Currencies. In addition, the market for Digital Currencies is still at an early stage and the number of market participants is limited and may stay limited over the lifetime of the Product. A small number of market participants could trigger potentially significant (and adverse) price swings and illiquidity, which events could have a material adverse effect on the return on and value of the Product and their liquidity.\n\nCustomer should further note that the trading hours of Digital Currencies typically exceed the trading hours of the Product. Customer therefore cannot invest in or divest the Product and react to price movements or volatility of the Digital Currencies outside the Product’s trading hours.\n\n<b>Risks relating to the illiquidity of Digital Currencies<\/b>\nDigital Currencies may be or may become illiquid over the lifetime of the Product. Illiquidity of the Digital Currency may (a) negatively impact the Issuer’s ability to provide a secondary market for the Product; (b) result in a temporary or even indefinite increase in the bid\/offer spread for the Product; (c) result in the postponement of a relevant valuation date (and any corresponding payment date); and (d) result in the (early) termination of the Product which could result in a loss to Customer in relation to the Product.\n\n<b>Access to Digital Currencies<\/b>\nCustomer in the Product do not have direct access to the Digital Currencies or all information relating to the Digital Currencies (such as, among other things, information about storage, service provider(s) used for trading the Digital Currencies or the so called \"private keys\" required for accessing and transferring the Digital Currencies) and cannot transfer the Digital Currencies related to the Product to a private storage facility. This may make it difficult for Customer to hedge their exposure resulting from the Product.\n\nTo the extent that the Customer holds Digital Currencies, the Customer understands and accepts that if his \"private key\" required to access his Digital Currencies and to dispose of his Digital Currencies were lost or stolen, the allocated Digital Currencies associated with the Customer's account (address) would be unrecoverable and would be permanently lost. The Customer will have no recourse to seek any refunds, recovery or replacements from the Issuer in the event that Digital Currencies are lost, hacked, destroyed or stolen. Also, any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the digital wallet or vault chosen by the Customer to receive and store Digital Currencies, including the Customer's own failure to properly maintain or use such digital wallet or vault, may also result in the loss of such Digital Currencies.\n\n<b>Trust in Digital Currencies<\/b>\nDigital Currencies only exist virtually and have no physical equivalent. Establishing a value for Digital Currencies is or may become difficult as the value depends on the expectation and trust that the relevant Digital Currencies have a future use. Among other things, persistent high volatility, changes and advances in technology, fraud, theft and cyber-attacks and regulatory changes may prevent the establishment of Digital Currencies for future use and potentially render the Digital Currencies worthless.\n\n<b>Risks relating to Technology<\/b>\nThere is a risk that the source code or protocol on which a Digital Currency is based may contain errors. Any such error could threaten the integrity and security of the relevant Digital Currency and the corresponding network. For example, the source code of Bitcoin or Ethereum is public and can be downloaded and inspected by anyone. Nevertheless, there could be an error in the source code that has not yet been found and rectified, or such an error could be exploited for as long as it has not been removed. There is the additional risk of an error that cannot be rectified. These risks could materially weaken the reputation of a Digital Currency, which could have an adverse effect on its market price.\n\nVarious Digital Currencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, were created in the form of open source software, i.e. as a programme that is freely available to everyone. The source code or protocol on which the Digital Currencies are based is publicly accessible and constantly being developed. The further development and acceptance of the protocol depends on a range of factors. The development of Digital Currencies could be hindered or delayed if disagreements were to arise between the participants, developers and members of the network.\n\nNew and improved versions of the source code must be confirmed by a majority of the members of the network in order to update the source code version. In the event that a majority of the network cannot be reached for the purpose of updating the source code, this could mean that urgent updates or improvements in the source code are implemented only partially or not at all. If the development of the source code is hindered or delayed, this may have an adverse effect on the value of the Digital Currency. Furthermore, there is a risk that one or more members of the network could control a majority of the network. In this case, the majority could impose changes in the source code that have an adverse effect on the market value of the Digital Currency concerned. For example, such changes could affect the verification procedure, the generation of private keys (which are necessary for the purpose of executing transactions) or the subsequent deletion of transactions. Such \"51% attacks\" could result in a general loss of confidence in the Digital Currency and the possible total cessation of trading. It may be difficult to keep track of these scenarios in some cases and they could permanently upset the equal status of the participants in the network. This would cause a loss of reputation and material adverse effects on the market value of the Digital Currency concerned. But even if such adverse scenarios are not realised, control of the majority of a network could have the same adverse effects for the market value of the Digital Currency. The risk of so- called 51% attacks is not limited to enforcing changes to the source code, but represents a general risk. Thus, a person or group of persons who make up the majority of the computing power of the network may manipulate transactions within the network (without changing the source code). The risk theoretically already exists below the 50% threshold, but is becoming increasingly unlikely. The risk of such attacks increases with the observed pooling of persons into so-called mining pools. \n\nThere is a risk that source codes or protocols could be developed further and for various reasons this could result in the Digital Currency splitting into more than one protocol (known as a \"hard fork\"). A hard fork is a basically change in the consensus rules such that computers running the old code no longer produce transactions recognized as valid by computers running the new code. A hard fork may be uncontentious, contentious, or a spin-off. An uncontentious hard fork can be viewed as a software upgrade that all (or nearly all) users agree is beneficial, such that only one network and one set of rules results from the change. In a contentious hard fork, disagreement amongst users may result in two competing incompatible networks that vie for the same brand. \n\nIn the context of a hard or soft fork, or other process that results in a division or split of a Digital Currency into multiple, possibly non-fungible, assets, it could be that trading platforms on which Digital Currencies are traded will temporarily suspend the ability to deposit or withdraw, or buy and sell, the relevant Digital Currency on that trading platform, until the risks and consequences that may result from the hard fork (such as replay attacks or network instability) have been definitively assessed. This could take several days in some circumstances, but such timeframe is in general not predictable. During any such temporary suspension, there is a risk that the market maker will not quote any bid and offer prices for the Product.\n\nFurthermore, in the event of a hard or soft fork, or other process that results in a division or split of a Digital Currency into multiple, possibly non-fungible, assets is expected, the Issuer has the discretion to take appropriate action to align the effects of such process (see also below under \"<b>Risks in relation to Digital Currency Adjustment Events<\/b>\"). There exists no right to compensation or ownership of any of such assets created in connection with or as a result of a fork. There is a further risk that in the case of a publicly accessible protocol, developers will not have the incentive of being remunerated for the further development of the source code. This could mean that the ongoing qualitative further development of the source code is hindered or delayed. If the source code is not developed further, however, this could have an adverse effect on the value of the Digital Currency concerned.\n\nCustomer should note that any of the events or processes as described above (including but not limited to hard or soft fork) may constitute a Digital Currency Adjustment Event under the terms and conditions of the Product and may result in an adjustment of the Product and\/or the (early) termination of the Product which could result in a loss to Customer in relation to the Product.\n\n<b>Risk in relation to Digital Currency Adjustment Events<\/b>\nAs a result of one or more Digital Currency Adjustment Events (including, but not limited to, a material change in the method of calculating the Digital Currency, a material change in the concept of the Digital Currency (such as a division or split of the Digital Currency into multiple assets) or the introduction of a tax on the Digital Currency, or otherwise as defined in any documentation), trading venues on which Digital Currencies are traded may suspend (temporarily or indefinitely) the ability to trade Digital Currencies or a particular version of a Digital Currency (where there are multiple versions of a Digital Currency due to a process that results in a division or split of a Digital Currency). Consequently, the Customer in the Product may (i) not get exposure (indefinitely) to all versions of a Digital Currency and forego the value of one or more versions, or (ii) may get exposure to a version on a delayed basis (in which case that version might have a significant change in its value), or (iii) may not benefit or be negatively affected by a Digital Currency adjustment event relating. Following a Digital Currency Adjustment Event, the Issuer may make (but has no obligation to make) an adjustment to the Product. In addition, Digital Currency Adjustment Events may result in instability of the relevant Digital Currency or a particular version of the Digital Currency and Digital Currency Adjustment Events or the threat of a potential Digital Currency Adjustment Events may prevent the establishment of the relevant Digital Currency. Digital Currency Adjustment Events may negatively impact the Issuer’s ability to provide a secondary market for a Product, may result in an increased bid\/offer spread (potentially indefinitely) for a Product or result in the (early) redemption of the Product which could result in a loss to Customer in relation to the Product.\n\n<b>Risks relating to the occurrence of Additional Disruption Events<\/b>\nAn Additional Disruption Event may, amongst others, occur if the Calculation Agent determines that it has become illegal to hold, acquire or dispose of any of the Digital Currencies or if the Issuer and\/or any hedging entity incurs significant losses related to hedging transactions with the Digital Currencies in particular as a result of fraud, theft and cyber-attacks relating to the custody account or the network of the Issuer and\/or any hedging party and\/or a relevant Service Provider. In this respect, Customer should note that the Digital Currencies held in a hedging entity’s custody accounts are not segregated on a per product basis. Any loss relating to a hedging entity’s custody account or network (please also refer to the section \"<b>Risks relating to fraud, theft and cyber-attacks<\/b>\" below) may trigger an Additional Disruption Event on in respect of the Product, as determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion.\n\nCustomer should note that following the occurrence of an Additional Disruption Event the Issuer may early redeem the Product and that they will receive the Non-scheduled Early Repayment Amount. Customer should note that the Non-scheduled Early Repayment Amount may be significantly lower than the Issue Price (as defined in any Product Terms) or may be even zero and the Customer may lose some or all of its investment.\n\n<b>Risks relating to fraud, theft and cyber-attacks<\/b>\nThe particular characteristics of Digital Currencies (e.g., that they only exist virtually on a computer network, transactions in the Digital Currency may not be reversible and may be largely anonymous) make it an attractive target for fraud, theft and cyber-attacks. Customer in the Product linked to a Digital Currency are exposed to fraud, theft and cyber-attacks, including: (i) any high profile losses as a result of such events may raise scepticism over the long-term future of Digital Currencies and may prevent the establishment of the Digital Currencies (or that particular Digital Currency) and may increase the volatility and illiquidity of the relevant Digital Currency; and (ii) any loss of the Issuer resulting from fraud, theft and cyber-attacks relating to service provider(s) may be borne by the Customer. Customer in the Product linked to a Digital Currency are exposed to such risks and the return on the Product (or the secondary market price) could be negatively affected by any such activities.\n\n<b>Regulatory Risks<\/b>\nDigital Currencies usually do not have a function as and\/or the full characteristics of a legal tender and are usually not supervised by any authority or institution such as a central bank. Consequently, there is no authority or institution which may intervene in the market of a Digital Currency to stabilise the value or prevent, mitigate or counter-attack irrational price developments.\n\nDigital Currencies have been in existence for relatively short time only and various regulatory bodies globally have or are in the process of taking a view on required regulatory actions relating to Digital Currencies and related products (e.g. regulation concerning money laundering, taxation, consumer protection, publication requirements or capital flows etc.). The regulatory status of Digital Currencies and blockchain technology still is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory authorities may apply existing regulation with respect to such technology and its applications, including specifically (but without limitation to) Digital Currencies. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether any legislative or regulatory authorities may implement changes to law and regulation affecting blockchain technology and its applications, including Digital Currencies.\n\nAny forthcoming regulatory actions may result in the illegality of Digital Currencies (and products relating to such Digital Currencies) or the implementation of controls relating to the trading (and therefore liquidity) of Digital Currencies. Forthcoming regulatory actions may also restrict the availability of markets and\/or market participants permitted to engaged in transactions related to Digital Currencies. Such events could result in an adjustment of the Product or even in the (early) termination of the Product which could result in a loss to Customer in relation to the Product. In addition, control mechanisms may increase transaction fees in Digital Currencies significantly (and therefore impact the bid\/offer spread of the Product) that may have a negative impact on the return of the Product (and the secondary market price of the Product). Customer should ensure that investing in the Product complies with their local regulation.\n\n<b>Connected Party Risk<\/b>\nDepending on the design of the relevant Digital Currencies (centralized, decentralized), certain connected parties (management, developers, miners etc. as applicable) may pursue a strategy which may negatively impact the value, tradability, liquidity and security of the Digital Currencies. Such events could result in an adjustment or even the (early) termination of the Product which could result in a loss to Customer in relation to the Product and may have a negative impact on the return of the Product (and the secondary market price of the Product).\n\n<b>Risk relating to Public Data<\/b>\nCustomer should be aware that any purchase and sale of Digital Currencies in connection with Product is stored in a ledger (blockchain) and may be visible to the public. Such ledger is neither a property of nor under control of the Issuer or the hedging entity or any other party related to these Product. Information available on the ledger may be exploited or miss-used in, as of today, unforeseen ways.\n\n<b>Risk relating to the Service Providers<\/b>\nThe Service Providers used by the Issuer or the hedging entity for trading and holding\/storing the Digital Currencies, (i) may cease to exist, (ii) may be exposed to fraud, theft and cyber-attacks (see the section “<b>Risks relating to fraud, theft and cyber-attacks<\/b>” above) or (iii) regulatory requirements and the Issuer’s internal compliance requirements may prevent the Issuer or the hedging entity to use a particular Reference Source or Service Provider for trading the Digital Currencies. This may potentially result in a larger bid-ask spread for a Product(e.g. due to a change in the trading commission payable to the Service Provider(s)). The Issuer (or any of its hedging entities) may not be able to replace a service provider, which may result in early termination of the Product.\n\n<b>Additional Risk Factors<\/b>\nCustomer should ensure that they fully understand the nature of this Product and the extent of their exposure to risks and they should consider the suitability of this Product as an investment in the light of their own circumstances and financial condition. Product may involve a high degree of risk, including the potential risk of expiring worthless. Customer should be prepared in certain circumstances to sustain a total loss of the capital invested to purchase this Product. Customer shall consider the following important risk factors and see this “<b>Risk Disclosure Statement<\/b>” for details.\n\nThis is a structured product involving derivative components. Customer should make sure that their advisors have verified that this Product is suitable for the portfolio of the Customer taking into account the Customer’s financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives. The terms and conditions of the Product may be subject to adjustments during the lifetime of the Product. Customer whose usual currency is not the currency in which the Product is redeemed should be aware of their possible currency risk. The value of the Product may not correlate with the value of the Underlying.\n\n<b>Market Risks<\/b>\nThe general market performance of Product is dependent, in particular, on the development of the capital markets which, for their part, are influenced by the general global economic situation as well as by the economic and political framework conditions in the respective countries (so-called market risk). Changes to market prices such as interest rates, commodity prices or corresponding volatilities may have a negative effect on the valuation of the Underlying(s) or the Product. There is also the risk of market disruptions (such as trading or market interruptions or discontinuation of trading) or other unforeseeable occurrences concerning the respective Underlying and\/ or their exchanges or markets taking place during the term or upon maturity of the Product. Such occurrences can have an effect on the time of redemption and\/or on the value of the Product.\n\n<b>No Other Payment<\/b>\nThis Product does not confer any claim to receive rights and\/or payments of the Underlying, unless explicitly stated herein, and therefore, without prejudice to any coupon payments provided for in any Agreement or documentation, does not yield any current income. This means that potential losses in value of the Product cannot be compensated by other income.\n\n<b>Credit Risk of Issuer<\/b>\nCustomer shall bear the credit risk of the Issuer of the Product. The value of the Product is dependent not only on the Underlying, but also on the creditworthiness of the Issuer, which may change over the term of the Product.\n\nThe Product constitutes unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer and rank pari passu with each and all other current and future unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer. The insolvency of the Issuer may lead to a partial or total loss of the invested capital.\n\n<b>Secondary Market<\/b>\nThe Issuer or any third party appointed by the Issuer, as applicable, intends, under normal market conditions, to provide bid and offer prices for the Product on a regular basis (if specified in the section “<b>General Notes and Disclaimer<\/b>”). However, the Issuer makes no firm commitment to provide liquidity by means of bid and offer prices for the Product, and assume no legal obligation to quote any such prices or with respect to the level or determination of such prices. In special market situations, where the Issuer is unable to enter into hedging transactions, or where such transactions are very difficult to enter into, the spread between the bid and offer prices may be temporarily expanded, in order to limit the economic risks of the Issuer. Customer must be prepared to hold the Product until the relevant maturity date as defined in any documentation.\n\nThe Product may only be assigned, sold or transferred to a third party with the prior consent of the Issuer and such can only be done, if it is a sale, in the form of a private placement. Thus, Customer must contact the Issuer before they consider reselling the Product.\n\n<b>Liquidity Risk<\/b>\nOne or, if applicable, more of the Underlying might be or become illiquid over the life time of the Product. llliquidity of an Underlying might lead to larger bid\/ offer spreads of the Product and\/or to an extended time period for buying and\/ or selling the Underlying respective to acquire, unwind or dispose of the hedging transaction(s) or asset(s) or to realise, recover or redeem the proceeds of such hedging transaction(s) or asset(s) which might implicate a postponed redemption or delivery and\/ or a modified redemption amount. as reasonably determined by the Calculation Agent.\n\n<b>Conflict of Interests<\/b>\nThe Issuer and\/or any third party appointed by them, as the case may be, may from time to time, as principal or agent, have positions in, or may buy or sell, or make a market as well as be active on both sides of the market at the same time in any currencies or other assets underlying the product(s) to which this document relates. The Issuer’s and\/ or the appointed third party’s trading and\/ or hedging activities related to this transaction may have an impact on the price of the Underlying and may affect the likelihood that any relevant threshold (e.g. a Level\/Price), if any, is reached.\n\n<b>Remunerations to Third Parties<\/b>\nDepending on the circumstances the Issuer may sell this Product to financial institutions or intermediaries at a discount to the Issue Price or reimburse a certain amount to such financial institutions or intermediaries (reference is made to section “<b>General Notes and Disclaimer<\/b>” herein). \n\nIn addition, for certain services rendered by distribution partners and to increase quality and services relating to the Product, the Issuer may from time to time pay trailer fees to such third parties. Further information is available on request by Customer.\n\n<b>Payment of a Coupon<\/b>\nIf the Product stipulates the payment of a coupon, the Customer is only entitled to receive the respective coupon payment, if he has purchased\/not sold the Product at the latest on the business day preceding the respective coupon payment date for the then prevailing price.\n\n<b>No Offer<\/b>\nThe Agreement is primarily provided for information purposes and does not constitute a recommendation, an offer or a solicitation of an offer to buy financial products.\n\n<b>No Representation<\/b>\nThe Issuer and any third party appointed by them make no representation or warranty relating to any information herein which is derived from independent sources.\n\n<b>No Advice<\/b>\nThis Agreement should not be construed as investment, financial, strategic, legal, regulatory, accounting or tax advice. It does not take into account the particular investment objectives, financial situation or needs of individual Customer. Certain transactions, including those involving futures, options and high yield product or securities, give rise to substantial risk and are not suitable for Customer. Accordingly, Customer should consider whether the Product described herein are suitable for their particular circumstances and should consult their own accounting, tax, investment and legal advisors before investing. Issuer is not acting as an advisor or fiduciary. Issuer does not accept any responsibility to update any opinions or other information contained in this Agreement.\n\n<b>No Prospectus<\/b>\nThis Agreement is not, and under no circumstances is to be construed as (i) a prospectus, (ii) an advertisement which is used to market or promote a prospectus, and\/or (iii) an advertisement where this document is used for the purposes of marketing.\n\n<b>No Bank Deposits<\/b>\nThe Product is not any bank deposit insured or guaranteed by any financial services compensation scheme or any other governmental agency or deposit protection fund run by public, private or community banks.\n\n<b>General Notes and Disclaimers<\/b>\nThis Agreement and the Product thereof do not constitute any collective investment schemes in the meaning of any applicable laws and regulations. Accordingly, Customer is exposed to the credit risk of the Issuer and the guarantor (if any). Accordingly, the value of the Product is dependent not only on the development of the Underlying Assets but, among others, also the creditworthiness of the Issuer and the guarantor (if any) which may vary over the term of the Product.\n\nThis Agreement has been prepared by the Issuer for information purposes only. It is not intended as an offer or solicitation of the purchase or sale of any securities, funds, structured products or any other structured investment products (“<b>Structured Investment Products<\/b>”). Purchasing Structured Investment Products involve derivatives and a higher degree of risk factors that may not be suitable for Customer. Such risks include risk of adverse or unanticipated market developments, issuer credit quality risk, risk of counterparty or issuer default, risk of lack of uniform standard pricing, risk of adverse events involving any underlying reference obligations, entity or other measure, risk of high volatility, and risk of illiquidity\/ little to no secondary market. In certain transactions, Customer may lose their entire investment, i.e., incur an unlimited loss.\n\nThis Agreement may only be distributed or circulated in countries where its distribution is legally permitted and may not be distributed in the US or to US residents.
