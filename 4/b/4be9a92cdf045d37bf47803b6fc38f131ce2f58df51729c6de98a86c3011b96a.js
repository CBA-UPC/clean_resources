Its story has Dutch roots, going back to when governor Peter Stuyvesant's farm sat in the vicinity of today's East 10th Street and Second Avenue. The area steadily developed as the city grew and farms were divided into plots, with immigrants moving in to newly constructed tenements in the early part of the 19th century. First came the Irish and Germans, followed in the 1880s by an influx of Italians, Russians, Romanians, Hungarians and Greeks. Yiddish theater flourished along Second Avenue, catering to the large Jewish population. Colorful as it all was, conditions in the tenements were abysmal, and the area became the focus of social reformers like Jacob A. Riis. It also became a hotbed of activism and radical politics, with anarchism and socialism debated in the streets. In the mid-20th century, Puerto Ricans moved in (referring to the area as Loisida), joined by African-Americans. The polyglot community, social tolerance, and cheap rents attracted the artists and writers of the Beat Generation. They set up poetry houses, coffee shops, and jazz clubs, and imbued it with the creative, edgy spirit it's known for today. The neighborhood declined in the 1970s and 1980s, but it kept luring artists, who, as always, attracted gentrifiers.

What's now Broadway was a Native American trail that snaked through farms and villages. In the early-19th century, Harsenville sat around 72nd Street and Bloomingdale Village at 100th Street, with country estates dotted between them. In the mid-19th century, some of these estates turned into inns as the area became a popular getaway from the city, which was then far downtown. Construction of train lines and Central Park spurred development here, and soon hotels lined the park. The Museum of Natural History (Central Park West and 79th St) was built in 1877. Elegant apartment buildings and mansions sprung up along Riverside Drive, West End Avenue and Central Park West, luring people who worked in the arts, sports, media and manufacturing. From the Great Depression to the 1970s, residents of the Upper West Side were mostly working- and middle-class; more affluent folks moved to the suburbs. Urban redevelopment projects, including slum clearances and the creation of Lincoln Center in the late 1960s, led to the neighborhood's cultural renaissance in the 1970s and 1980s."}]},774567513:{url:"https://hotpads.com/boise-id/apartments-for-rent",questions:[{question:"What are the Safest Neighborhoods to live in Boise, ID?",answerType:"orderedList",answer:["<a href='https://hotpads.com/north-end-boise-id/apartments-for-rent'>North End</a>","<a href='https://hotpads.com/east-end-boise-id/apartments-for-rent'>East End/Warms Springs</a>","<a href='https://hotpads.com/depot-bench-boise-id/apartments-for-rent'>Depot Bench</a>","<a href='https://hotpads.com/harris-ranch-boise-id/apartments-for-rent'>Harris Ranch</a>","<a href='https://hotpads.com/southeast-boise-boise-id/apartments-for-rent'>Southeast Boise</a>","<a href='https://hotpads.com/northwest-boise-id/apartments-for-rent'>Northwest Boise</a>","<a href='https://hotpads.com/warm-springs-mesa-boise-id/apartments-for-rent'>Warm Springs Mesa</a>","<a href='https://hotpads.com/barber-boise-id/apartments-for-rent'>Barber</a>","<a href='https://hotpads.com/vernon-boise-id/apartments-for-rent'>Vernon</a>","<a href='https://hotpads.com/hillcrest-boise-id/apartments-for-rent'>Hillcrest</a>"]}]},778160025:{url:"https://hotpads.com/idaho-falls-id/apartments-for-rent",questions:[{question:"Area Information",answerType:"answer",answer:"Idaho Falls is the largest city i onneville County, Idaho.

SoHo has a split personality. In the morning, when the sun slants on Belgian-block streets and charming storefronts yawn open, it feels a bit like Europe. As if in a photo shoot, stylish locals casually emerge from cast-iron buildings to grab coffee. Bikes flow down Prince Street and buttery aromas waft from French bakeries. But by midday, SoHo's narrow sidewalks are so clogged with bodies—tourists, shoppers, workers and street vendors—that it instead resembles Times Square. The art studio scene of the 1970s is pretty much gone, though a handful of artists remain by the grace of rent control.

A Native American trail that ran the length of Manhattan passed through it, later becoming Broadway. Some of the land was owned by former slaves freed by the Dutch West India Company, making it the first free African-American settlement on Manhattan island. The hills were eventually leveled and the soil used to fill in the polluted canal and marshland to the south of the area. Once it became suitable for development, the area was quickly built up, lined with red-brick Federal townhouses for the wealthy. In the mid-19th century, the neighborhood transitioned from a residential tract to a commercial and entertainment district. Broadway was lined with stores, hotels, theaters and music halls, while the cobbled side streets became a red-light district. Between 1860 and 1865, the neighborhood's population dropped by 25%, due to its increasingly sordid character and an influx of manufacturing businesses. Old buildings were demolished and replaced with factories and warehouses constructed with cast iron, and SoHo became a center for the textile and dry-goods industries. As the city pushed northward at the turn of the 20th century, major businesses moved out of SoHo and were replaced by smaller, less-fashionable ones. The beautiful cast-iron buildings sat largely forgotten until the 1960s, when artists moved in and used the large lofts as studios. The artists were able to get the warehouse zoning laws modified in a way that allowed both them and the remaining industry to use the buildings, and the area became a hive of contemporary art. A large part of the neighborhood between West Broadway and Crosby wasdesignatedthe SoHo-Cast Iron historic district in 1973.

Though now flat, there was once a hill called Cobbleshill at the corner of Atlantic Avenue and Court Street. During the Revolutionary War, the Americans built a fort on the site, but the British captured the fort and cut off the top of the hill to eliminate the vantage point. Lik rooklyn Heights, the area remained rural into the 19th century. Improved transportation across the East River by ferry, bridge and (later) train eased the commute to Manhattan and spurred the borough's growth. Many of the houses here today date from 1840 to 1880. One notable 19th-century development is at Hicks and Warren Streets, where philanthropist Alfred T. White built working- and middle-class housing. With small houses along a private courtyard, the development looks as though it was transplanted from an English village. But this quaintness doesn't come cheap; these 12-feet-wide 'workingmen's cottages' now fetch upwards of $1 million each. Virtually the entire neighborhood was designated a historic district in 1969.

In the 1840s and 1850s, the neighborhood became a major junction of the Underground Railroad, due to its proximity to the harbor (where escaped slaves arrived under cover) and a famous local abolitionist preacher, Henry Ward Beecher. The opening of the Brooklyn Bridge and subways made Brooklyn Heights grow exponentially, as it became possible to commute easily into Manhattan.

But unlik ed Hookan obble Hill, bisected by the highway, Brooklyn Heights had the clout to negotiate a more attractive plan. Thus, the BQE led to one of the neighborhood's greatest attributes, the Brooklyn Heights Promenade — a walkway and garden that overlooks the harborandcovers the highway.

There aren't any expansive green spaces, but there are several small neighborhood parks with basketball courts. Hamilton Fish Parkhas an Olympic-sized pool and playground. Corlears Hook Park, on the East River, has large and small dog runs, and great views of the Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridges. Families wanting peace and quiet might consider living elsewhere. There are a lot of noisy bars here, and at night sidewalks are packed, especially on weekends. Now on the radar of the bridge-and-tunnel crowd, the Lower East Side is a destination for a rowdy Saturday night out. Things are more sedate on the west side, i ribecaand th est Village, and in parts of th inancial District."},{question:"Neighborhood Life",answerType:"answer",answer:"The Lower East Side is a lively place with a lot to see.

(Delancey's farm included an orchard, in the area around today's Orchard Street.) After the Revolutionary War, the land was developed and in the 19th century the neighborhood became a first stop for immigrants. The area has long been defined by its immigrants, with groups cycling in and out — as one grew more affluent and moved on, another arrived. Early settlers were Irish and German, such that the northern portion of the Lower East Side was known as Kleindeutchland, or Little Germany. Later, Italians, Poles and Ukrainians moved into the area. Eastern European Jews arrived in large numbers beginning in the 1880s. There were so many, in fact, that had the area been a separate city, it would have had been largest Jewish city in the world in the late-19th century. The streets were filled withpushcart vendorsand lined with crowded tenements. It wasn't unusual for six or more people to live in two small rooms of a tenement apartment. The apartments often doubled as family workplaces, with many people working in the garment industry."},{question:"Notable addresses",answerType:"unorderedList",answer:["<strong>56 Ludlow
